Bruce Hansen's recent textbook
[Introduction to Econometrics](https://www.ssc.wisc.edu/~bhansen/probability/)
compares statistical commands in Matlab/Base R/STATA on page 114. 

CDF:

| RV | Julia | MATLAB | Base R | STATA | Mathematica | Python |
| --- | --- | --- |  --- | --- |
| $N(0,1)$ | `cdf(Normal(0,1),x)` | `normcdf(x)` | `pnorm(x)` | `normal(x)` |
| $\chi^2\_{r}$ | `cdf(Chisq(r),x)` | `chi2cdf(x,r)` | pchisq(x,r) | chi2(r,x) |
| $t_r$ | cdf(TDist(r),x) | tcdf(x,r) | pt(x,r) | 1-ttail(r,x) |
| $F_{r,k}$ | cdf(FDist(r,k),x) | fcdf(x,r,k) | pf(x,r,k) | F(r,k,x) |
| $D(\theta)$ | cdf(D(θ),x) | Dcdf(x,θ) | pD(x,θ) | ? |

Inverse Probabilities (quantiles):

| RV | Julia | MATLAB | Base R | STATA |
| --- | --- | --- |  --- | --- |
| $N(0,1)$ | quantile(Normal(0,1),p) | norminv(p) | qnorm(p) | invnormal(p) |
| $\chi^2\_{r}$ | quantile(Chisq(r),p) | chi2inv(x,r) | qchisq(p,r) | invchi2(r,p) |
| $t_r$ | quantile(TDist(r),p) | tinv(x,r) | qt(p,r) | invttail(r,1-p) |
| $F_{r,k}$ | quantile(FDist(r,k),p) | finv(x,r,k) | qf(p,r,k) | invF(r,k,p) |
| $D(\theta)$ | quantile(D(θ),p) | Dinv(p,θ) | qD(p,θ) | invD(p,θ) |


General syntax in Julia:
Distributions.jl distinguishes between a Random Variable's parameters and property variables. 
A random variable is a struct such as `Chisq(r)` or `D(θ)`. 
A property of a random variable such as CDF or mean is (typically) a functional
which takes random variable as its argument along with any necesarry property specific variables.

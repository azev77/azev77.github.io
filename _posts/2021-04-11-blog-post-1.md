The goal of this post is to illustrate a point made in a 
recent [tweet](https://twitter.com/AmitEcon/status/1368990015536119813?s=20) 
by [Amit Ghandi](https://web.sas.upenn.edu/agandhi/) 
that [Simpson's Paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simpson%27s_paradox) 
is a special case of 
[omitted variable bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omitted-variable_bias) (OVB).

Let's start with some definitions:<br/>
**Simpsonâ€™s Paradox**: a statistical phenomenon where an association between two variables in a population emerges, disappears or reverses when the population is divided into subpopulations.<br/>
**Omitted Variable Bias**: when a statistical model leaves out one or more variables that is _both_ correlated with the treatment and the outcome. 

Example: COVID-19 in China versus Italy

Let's use an example from 
[How SIMPSON'S PARADOX explains weird COVID19 statistics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-Ci3FosqZs). 
(This example is for illustrative purposes only. This post is about interpreting statistics, not COVID-19).

Aren't headings cool?

The goal of this post is to illustrate a point made in a 
recent [tweet](https://twitter.com/AmitEcon/status/1368990015536119813?s=20) 
by [Amit Ghandi](https://web.sas.upenn.edu/agandhi/) 
that [Simpson's Paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simpson%27s_paradox) 
is a special case of 
[omitted variable bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omitted-variable_bias).

Let's start with some definitions:
<br/>
**Simpsonâ€™s Paradox**: a statistical phenomenon where an association between two variables in a population emerges, disappears or reverses when the population is divided into subpopulations.
<br/>
**Omitted Variable Bias (OVB)**: when a statistical model leaves out one or more variables that is _both_ correlated with the treatment and the outcome. 
<br>
<b>Case Fatality Rate (CFR)</b>: 
the proportion of people who die from a specified disease among all individuals diagnosed with the disease over a certain period of time.


Example: COVID-19 in China versus Italy
======
Let's use an example from 
[How Simpson's paradox explains weird COVID19 statistics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-Ci3FosqZs). 
(This example is for illustrative purposes only. This post is about interpreting statistics, not COVID-19). 
The video compares those diagnosed with COVID-19 in China and Italy between March and May 2020. 
<br>
<u>CFR by country</u>: people infected with COVID-19 were more likely to die in Italy than China. 
<br>
<u>CFR by country-age group</u>: at each age bracket, people infected with COVID-19 were more likely to die in China than Italy.

Simulate Data
------
Let's illustrate this with a simulation in [the Julia Language](https://julialang.org/).
<br>
The variables are defined in the table below:
<br>
$X \sim N\left(\mu, \sigma^2 \right)$

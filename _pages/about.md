# Research Agenda
* In the canonical model of asset pricing, house prices equal the present value 
<!--
#are equal to the present discounted value 
-->
of future net rents (or shelter service flows for owner-occupiers):
* $$ \begin{align*}  
p_{t} &= \sum_{i=1}^{i=\infty} \frac{ \text{Rent}_{t+i} }{ (1+r)^{i} } 
\end{align*} $$
* My research studies benefits of home ownership which are consumed by owners but not by renters. 
* The ability to [pledge a home a collateral](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2815609) (along with the tax benefits) is enjoyed by owners but not by renters.
* The ability to [protect home equity from unsecured creditors](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3763242) is enjoyed by owners but not by renters.

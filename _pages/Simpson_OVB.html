The goal of this post is to illustrate a point made in a recent 
<a href="https://twitter.com/AmitEcon/status/1368990015536119813?s=20">tweet</a>
by 
<a href="https://web.sas.upenn.edu/agandhi/">Amit Ghandi </a>
that Simpson's Paradox is a special case of omitted variable bias (OVB).

<br> <br>
I will use an example from 
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-Ci3FosqZs">How SIMPSON'S PARADOX explains weird COVID19 statistics</a>.
(This example is for illustrative purposes only. This post is about statistics, not COVID-19).
<br> 
The video compares those diagnosed with COVID-19 in China and Italy between March and May 2020. 
<br>
<u>Outcome by country</u>: people infected with COVID-19 were more likely to survive in China than Italy. 
<br>
<u>Outcome by country-age group</u>: at each age bracket, people infected with COVID-19 were more likely to survive in Italy than China.

<br> <br>
Let's illustrate this with a simulation in 
<a href="https://julialang.org/">the Julia Language</a>. 
<br>
The variables are defined in the table below:
\begin{array}{|l|l|l|}
\hline
  \text{Outcome: } Y_{i} & \text{Treatment: } X_{i} & \text{Confounder: } Z_{i}\\ 
\hline
Y_{i} \equiv 0 \text{ if person i survives} & X_{i} \equiv 0 \text{ if person i is in China} & Z_{i} \equiv 0 \text{ if person i's age } \leq 59 \\
Y_{i} \equiv 1 \text{ if person i dies}     & X_{i} \equiv 1 \text{ if person i is in Italy} & Z_{i} \equiv 1 \text{ if person i's age } > 59 \\
\hline
\end{array}

Let's assume the true data generating process (DGP) is: 
$Y_{i} = \beta_{0} + \beta_{xy} X_{i} + \beta_{zy} Z_{i} + \varepsilon_{i}$
<br>
Assume $\beta_{0}=10, \beta_{xy} = -5, \beta_{zy} = 10$ (coefficients are in %). 
<br>
Let's generate some artificial data. 
<br>
Suppose we have N=200 observations (half China, half Italy). 
<br>
Suppose 80% of China's population is young $Z_{i} =0$ and 20% is old $Z_{i} = 1$.
<br>
Suppose 20% of Italy's population is young $Z_{i} =0$ and 80% is old $Z_{i} = 1$.
<pre>
    <code style="display:block; white-space:pre-wrap; background-color: rgb(234,236,238);">
  using DataFrames, Plots
  N = 200;           #200 observations = 100 in China + 100 in Italy.
  β_0 = 10.0; β_Italy = -5.0; β_Age = 10.0;
  #
  df = DataFrame(
      Y =        [ones(8);zeros(80-8);  ones(4);zeros(20-4);  
                  ones(1);zeros(20-1);  ones(12);zeros(80-12);], 
      Intercept = ones(N), 
      Italy     = [zeros(100); ones(100)], 
      Age = [zeros(80);ones(100-80); 
             zeros(20);ones(100-20);],
      )
    </code>
</pre>

1. Let's estimate the <b>unconditional</b> probability of death from COVID-19 in this data: 
<br> 
$$Y_{i} = \beta_{0} + \varepsilon_{i}$$
<pre>
    <code style="display:block; white-space:pre-wrap; background-color: rgb(234,236,238);">
    y = df.Y; X = ones(N);
    β = X \ y   # 12.5%
    mean(y)     # 12.5% 
    </code>
</pre>

\begin{array}{|l|l|l|}
\hline
P\left( \text{Death from COVID-19} \right) = 12.5\%
\\ 
\hline
\end{array}


<br> 
2. Let's estimate the probability of death from COVID-19 <b>conditional only on country</b>: 
<br> 
$$Y_{i} = \beta_{0} + \beta_{xy} X_{i} + \varepsilon_{i}$$
<pre>
    <code style="display:block; white-space:pre-wrap; background-color: rgb(234,236,238);">
    y = df.Y; X = [ df.Intercept df.Italy];
    β = X \ y   
    β[1]         # 12%
    β[1] + β[2]  # 13% 
    </code>
</pre>
\begin{array}{|l|l|l|}
\hline
P\left( \text{Death from COVID-19 } | \text{ China} \right) = 12\%
\\ \hline
P\left( \text{Death from COVID-19 } | \text{ Italy} \right) = 13\%
\\
\hline
\end{array}


<br> 


3. Let's estimate the probability of death from COVID-19 <b>conditional on country and age</b>: 
<br> 
$$Y_{i} = \beta_{0} + \beta_{xy} X_{i} + \beta_{zy} Z_{i} + \varepsilon_{i}$$
<pre>
    <code style="display:block; white-space:pre-wrap; background-color: rgb(234,236,238);">
    y = df.Y; X = [ df.Intercept df.Italy df.Age];
    β = X \ y   
    β[1]         # 10%
    β[1] + β[2]  # 5%
    </code>
</pre>

Summarize $P\left( \text{Death from COVID-19 } | \text{ Country, Age} \right)$ in the following table:
\begin{array}{|l|l|l|}
\hline
 & \text{Young } (Z_{i} = 0) & \text{Old }  (Z_{i} = 1)  \\ \hline
\text{China } (X_{i} = 0) & 10\% & 20\%     \\ \hline
\text{Italy } (X_{i} = 1) & 5\% & 15\%     \\ \hline
\end{array}

<br> 
Without conditioning on age, Italy has a <b>higher</b> probability of Death than China (13% vs 12%). 
<br> 
Once we condition on age, within each age bracket Italy has a <b>lower</b> probability of Death than China (5% vs 10% for young & 15% vs 20% for old).





<br> <br>
Next we will show how Simpson's paradox is a special case of OVB. 
<br>
Suppose the true model is:
$$Y_{i} = \beta_{0} + \beta_{xy} X_{i} + \beta_{zy} Z_{i} + \nu_{i}$$
<br>
Suppose you omit $Z_{i}$ and instead estimate:
$$Y_{i} = \beta_{0} + \beta_{xy} X_{i} + u_{i} \Rightarrow u_{i} = \beta_{zy} Z_{i} + \nu_{i} $$
<br>
Suppose $X_{i}$ predicts $Z_{i}$:
$$Z_{i} = \delta_{xz} X_{i} + w_{i} \Rightarrow \delta_{xz} = \frac{\sigma_{xz}}{\sigma_{x}^2} = \rho_{xz}\times \frac{\sigma_{z}}{\sigma_{x}} $$
<br>
Denote the OLS estimate (from the equation that omits age) $\hat{\beta}_{xy}$. 
<br>
We have: $E[\hat{\beta}_{xy}|X_{i}] = \beta_{xy} + \underbrace{\delta_{xz} \beta_{zy}}_{\text{bias}}$       <a href="#section1">[1]</a>
<br>
$\text{Bias} = \delta_{xz} \beta_{zy} = 
\left( \rho_{xz}\times \frac{\sigma_{z}}{\sigma_{x}} \right)
\times 
\left( \rho_{zy}\times \frac{\sigma_{y}}{\sigma_{z}} \right)
=
\rho_{xz}\times \rho_{zy} \times \frac{\sigma_{y}}{\sigma_{x}} 
$
<br>
The bias is the product of 
(1) the impact of the treatment on the OV $\delta_{xz}$ 
and
(2) the impact of the OV on the outcome $\beta_{zy}$.
<br>
The estimate will be unbiased if either (1) the treatment is uncorrelated w/ the OV, 
or 
(2) the OV is uncorrelated w/ the outcome.



<p>[1] To derive the bias, slightly abuse notation by stacking a column of ones and $X_{i}$ into a matrix "X", and stack 
$\beta_{0}$ and $\beta_{xy}$ into $\beta$:</p>
\begin{align*} 
\hat{\beta} =& (X'X)^{-1} X'Y 
\\ 
=& (X'X)^{-1} X'(X\beta + Z\beta_{zy} + \nu_{i}) 
\\ 
=& \beta + (X'X)^{-1} X'Z \beta_{zy} + (X'X)^{-1} X'Z \nu_{i}
\\
E[\hat{\beta}_{xy}|X ] 
=& 
\beta + (X'X)^{-1} X'Z \beta_{zy} 
\\
=& 
\beta + \delta_{xz} \beta_{zy} 
\end{align*}

Let's start with a definition:
<br>
 <b>Case Fatality Rate (CFR)</b>: 
the proportion of people who die from a specified disease among all individuals diagnosed with the disease over a certain period of time.
<br> 
We will compare those diagnosed with COVID-19 in China and Italy between March and May 2020. 
<br>
<u>Outcome by country</u>: people infected with COVID-19 were more likely to survive in China than Italy 
<br>
<u>Outcome by country-age group</u>: at each age bracket, people infected with COVID-19 were more likely to survive in Italy than China



<br> <br>
Example: 
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-Ci3FosqZs">Covid</a>
<br> 
Y = case fatality rate
<br> 
X = country China/Italy
<br> 
Z = age
